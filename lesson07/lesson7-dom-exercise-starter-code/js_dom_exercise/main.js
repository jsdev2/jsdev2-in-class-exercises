/* DOM Manipulation: Independent Practice

******FIRST******
First, read this page about something we didn't cover, prompts!
http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_prompt.asp
*****************

To complete this excercise, you must meet the following requirements:

- When the user clicks the "#new-thing-button" button, display a prompt 
  asking what their favorite things are.
- When they hit enter, take the value they've typed in and add it to the list 
  (remember: appendChild)

*/

window.onload = function() {
  // when someone clicks the button...

  // http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_prompt.asp
  // var yourName = prompt("What is your name?");

  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild
};

/*

Bonus:

When they don't type anything into the prompt, alert the user 
"you must type in a value!"

Extra Bonus: 

Instead of a prompt, have the user enter new things using an input box.
When the user presses "submit", the value of the input box should be 
appended to the list of things, and the input box should be cleared.
Hint: input elements have a "value" attribute, which is the value that 
the user is typing in. It can be read and also it can be set.
